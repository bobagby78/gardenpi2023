Gardenpi uses an 8 relay module to control power to various components to run an aquaponic grow system consisting of 2 fish tanks, one for the aquaponic garden and one for overflow (because guppies reproduce A LOT!!!)

the relay module is run by a single board computer.

the GPIO pins are set up as such:

relay 1 is controlled by pin 37
relay 2 is controlled by pin 35
relay 3 is controlled by pin 33
relay 4 is controlled by pin 31
relay 5 is controlled by pin 29
relay 6 is controlled by pin 15
relay 7 is controlled by pin 13
relay 8 is controlled by pin 11
